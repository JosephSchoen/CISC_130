    Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, is a software application that is designed to offer advanced applications for people who are programming. The idea is that it compiles
    multiple tools and features into one application for the advantage of the user. It can include things such as a text editor that will translate into a readable line of code that
    performs actions. It can be built for easy online use to share with other users to collectively work on projects. It is a great tool for programmers because it allows for more productivity
    all under one main service rather than using multiple programs and switching the files around to get the same work done complete that an IDE can get done.
